## KAIST AE280 항공우주응용 소프트웨어  

This project focuses on designing an aircraft auto-control system that optimizes controller gain to minimize peak time while ensuring stability constraints like damping ratio, settling time, and percent overshoot. Using MATLAB, the control system is modeled, third-order transfer functions are reduced to second-order for analysis, and optimization techniques identify the best gain (K=0.1563). Compared to PID controllers, the proposed method offers better stability and performance for aircraft control in steady flight.
