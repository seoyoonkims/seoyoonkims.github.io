### Efficient Parallel Execution through Hybrid Sorting Algorithms  

This project optimizes 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a cutting-edge real-time rendering technique, by addressing sorting inefficiencies that cause up to 30% latency in rendering. The proposed hybrid sorting mechanism combines Radix Sort for high-level partitioning and Bitonic Sort for localized, memory-efficient sorting within buckets. The approach incorporates bucket-based partitioning and early termination strategies to minimize redundant computations, achieving up to 8.09% performance improvement while reducing memory usage. This makes it ideal for applications in mobile and virtual reality systems.
