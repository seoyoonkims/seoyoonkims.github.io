### Multi-Node Gesture Recognition for Secure Embedded Messaging  

This project involves designing a secure embedded messenger system where messages are transmitted using hand gestures detected by an accelerometer. Five nodes (devices) are used, each representing a team member, with predefined hand gesture mappings for 10 messages. The messages are sequentially transmitted through the nodes, where each device lights up a corresponding LED to indicate the received message. A hybrid mechanism ensures robustness in gesture detection and secure communication within a predefined hardware environment.
