## KAIST EE488 Deep Learning for Visual Understanding  
### 시각적 이해를 위한 심층학습  

---

This project develops a face recognition model using the ResNet-18 architecture with two datasets: a clean Train1 set and a noisy Train2 set. Key techniques include Triplet Loss for early feature extraction, Softmax for final fine-tuning, and dynamic masking to filter noise in Train2. Extensive data augmentation (e.g., cropping, flipping) and hyperparameter optimization were also applied, achieving improved validation and test performance.
