## KAIST EE312 Computer Architectrure  
### 컴퓨터구조개론  

This Verilog project implements a RISC-V processor with several key modules:

---

RISCV_TOP: Acts as the top-level module integrating all subcomponents including control logic, memory access, and pipeline stages.  
ALU: Implements arithmetic and logic operations supporting RISC-V instruction sets, such as add, subtract, bitwise operations, and comparisons.  
Pipeline and Hazard Management: Includes modules like HAZARD.v to handle data hazards and pipeline stalls effectively.  
Memory Interface: CACHE.v and D_Mem_Model.v facilitate efficient memory read/write operations, including hit/miss handling.  
Control Logic and Immediate Generation: CTRL.v and IMMEDIATE.v decode instructions and manage control signals.
